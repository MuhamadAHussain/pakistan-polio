          <span class="text-left">

Ayesha Raza is a 35-year-old polio survivor and health worker in the government-run polio eradication programme in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore.
<br><br>
Her condition is deteriorating with age, she says. She experiences random numbness in her arms and legs, and she cannot recall how many times she has fallen on the road.
<br><br>
Despite her health issues, Ayesha, who has an eight-month-old daughter, works in the field, going from door to door administering oral polio vaccines to children aged six and under at up to 80 houses in her area every month.
<br><br>
But some people have not been receptive. 
<br><br>
She has been shouted at, had gates slammed shut in her face and been ridiculed. Work is tiring and her employers have refused to provide any assistance, given her condition. But Ayesha feels that in addition to being able to provide for her family financially, she has a moral responsibility.
<br><br>
“Initially, I used to curse myself for taking up this job,” she told Al Jazeera. “People would just slam the door in my face without even talking to me. I used to get angry. Later I realised that, for me, it’s more than a job. I tell parents they will never realise how I’m feeling every day [because of polio]. And the two drops [of polio vaccine] I give to their kids will help them in the end.
<br><br>
“I have polio. I feel weak. I have to walk for kilometres on end every day during the campaign. That’s my job. But I need to make sure these kids do not go through what I have gone through.”
<br><br>
<h2> Challenges and obstacles </h2>
<br><br>
Some 350km (218 miles) away in Multan, Razia Bibi, 48, is fighting a different type of obstacle.
Among other healthcare work, she has been administering polio vaccines since 1996. But when she recently learned how to ride a motorcycle, residents went to her brother to complain, showing their displeasure at the sight of a woman on the motorbike.
<br><br>
“It’d take a long time to reach the areas which I was covering, almost an hour and a half. So I bought a motorcycle and asked my son to teach me how to ride it,” Razia said.
<br><br>
“It’s not only for the polio campaigns but also helps me take pregnant women for checkups. It was then that people would just stare at me. They just couldn’t see a woman riding a bike.” 
<br><br>
Thankfully, her family is supportive of what she does and her brother brushed off the complaints.
<br><br>
The incident did not deter Razia because, she says, she has become thick-skinned in the face of obstacles that have been part of this work.
<br><br>
Ayesha and Razia are just three of more than 350,000 officials who have been part of Pakistan’s mission to eradicate polio. Many like them have also been harassed, ridiculed, taunted and threatened.
<br><br>
Amir, a 33-year-old polio survivor based in the southern city of Karachi, is among them. 
<br><br>
Unable to finish higher education because of the costs, Amir first took up a job as a computer operator before signing up with the polio eradication campaign.
<br><br>
He says it was difficult growing up “different to others”. In school, he was bullied often. But, Amir says, his strength was in his resilience to shrug off the attacks and “make it my power, my force”. 
<br><br>
While delivering vaccines in the field, he was shoved and slapped by one father who did not want his child vaccinated during a campaign. In another, a father who refused vaccination for his children threatened to kill Amir if he saw him in the area again.
<br><br>
“These are testing conditions, especially in the heat,” Amir told Al Jazeera. “But this is something I need to do. If I had taken those two drops as a kid, I wouldn’t have been like this. Now, it’s very important that we save someone else’s kid. And that’s what I tell people I visit to try and convince them.”
<br><br>
The issues do not stop at threats. At least 102 polio field workers and security officials accompanying the teams have been killed by the Pakistan Taliban and other armed groups during the campaigns.
<br><br>
Some spend long hours on the streets, often toiling in the heat or the cold as they deliver the vaccines. For others, it’s a mission to help eradicate polio in Pakistan.
<br><br>
Here are some of their stories:

            Sidra, 32, started work on the polio eradication campaign in 2018 after her divorce. She says it’s “very difficult” to manage this work around her household responsibilities but wants to help the children and earn enough to provide a decent education for her young daughter. Due to her lack of education, Sidra says she was unable to find a job and, given the situation in Pakistan, she took up this role despite the money being “not enough”.

            The 35-year-old mother of one is a polio survivor based in Lahore. Because of polio, she does not have the energy levels needed to administer vaccines on foot during campaigns. Her husband is unemployed but financial needs have not deterred Ayesha from working in the field, going from door to door and vaccinating children in up to 80 households every month.

            <h2> Razia - Multan </h2>
            Razia has been administering polio vaccines since 1996. She has faced plenty of refusals as well as being the subject of harassment, taunting and mocking. 
            She says attitudes towards the vaccines have changed considerably over time. Not only have the refusal rates dropped significantly, but parents often bring their children to her if they miss a campaign. 
            Due to the large area she has to cover during the polio campaigns, as well as assisting pregnant women with travel, Razia learned how to ride a motorcycle a couple of years ago despite criticism from some in her community who disapproved.

She was close to giving up but then told herself that, “There will always be obstacles in life when you’re trying to do something good.” That thought spurred her on and, despite the taunts and hooting, Gulnaz stuck to her aim of trying to reach the maximum number of children so that no “innocent flower [child]” ever has to deal with the poliovirus.

            Saba says her team administers about 250 vaccinations each day and health workers are paid 600 to 900 Pakistani rupees (approximately $2-$3) daily.

Pakistan is one of only two countries in the world where poliovirus is still endemic - the other being neighbouring Afghanistan.
<br><br>
The two countries share a 2,611km (1,622 miles) long border.
<br><br>
<img src="./gfx/bordercrossingsAFPAK.jpg" width="120%" height="auto" alt="photo caption"/>
<br><br>
Since 2015, Pakistan has reported 366 polio cases, including 16 this year - all of the YB3A strain which has come in from Afghanistan. 
<br><br>
<img src="./gfx/number_poliocases.jpg" width="120%" height="auto" alt="photo caption"/>
<br><br>
The figure has come down from the 20,000 per year that have been reported by officials who say that the numbers are falling due to increased surveillance and sampling, 
and there remains just one local cluster of the poliovirus in Pakistan – the YB3C - cases of which were last discovered in November 2023.
<br><br>
In addition to human cases, wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has frequently been detected in environmental samples taken across the country. This year, WPV1 has been found in 62 of Pakistan’s 166 districts.
<br><br>
“Unfortunately, we can’t stop the virus from coming in,” Shahzad Baig, former national coordinator of Pakistan’s polio-eradication programme, who resigned at the end of May, told Al Jazeera.
<br><br>
“The strain we are detecting in environmental samples and children this year is the YB3A which is found in Afghanistan. Because of that, we’ve tightened our vaccinations at the border, made entry and exit points vaccination centres in all major districts at the border and are also focusing on travel routes from those districts to Quetta, Peshawar and Karachi, the three major destinations.”
<br><br>
The focus has shifted to what officials call a very mobile population. 
<br><br>
In addition, authorities are also up against two significant obstacles in their fight against polio - security issues and vaccine refusals.
<br><br>
At least 102 polio field workers and security officials accompanying the teams have been killed during campaigns across Pakistan, including at least six in campaigns carried out this year.
<br><br>
Resistance to the polio immunisation drive grew in Pakistan after the CIA, a United States spy agency, organised a fake hepatitis vaccination drive to track al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was killed in 2011 in Pakistan by US special forces.
<br><br>
Misinformation linked to religious beliefs has also been spread, claiming that the vaccine contains traces of pork and alcohol, which are forbidden in Islam.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Disinformation, agenda-driven campaigns, myths, community boycotts and mistrust in the government have also been factors behind refusals. 
<br><br>
In recent years, the Pakistan Taliban has also been behind the killings of health workers and security forces in the northern part of the country.
<br><br>
“Over the last few years, it is not the polio programme that is targeted, but unfortunately, the targets are the security personnel guarding the teams because, given the security situation in some parts of the country, they become soft targets when they are in the community,” Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO’s director of polio eradication, told Al Jazeera.
<br><br>
Many more workers have been wounded. Some have given up.

<h2>Threats, harassment and wild rumours</h2>

Apart from the physical attacks, polio workers have also been targets of verbal attacks, threats, harassment and the misinformation campaign which is a contributing factor to vaccine refusals.
<br><br>
“Over the last decade, the polio eradication effort has gone through multiple ups and downs,” Jafari said.
<br><br>
“If you don’t eradicate it, you will see sporadic outbreaks. That’s why Pakistan and Afghanistan haven’t succeeded in stopping its transmission. They go through periods of very little cases and detections and then there’s a resurgence and you get an outbreak.”
<br><br>
Health authorities in Pakistan have listed seven districts classified as “endemic” in the country. All seven lie in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where officials say the security situation has been the biggest obstacle in reaching the target audience.
<br><br>
<img src="./gfx/polioendemicPK.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="photo caption"/>
<br><br>
Marginalised communities have also resorted to boycotting the campaigns, demanding better civil services and infrastructure, including roads, schools and hospitals, from the government before allowing the health workers to carry out work in their areas.
<br><br>
Aidan O’Leary, the late WHO director for polio eradication, told Al Jazeera recently that these communities are “essentially using whatever means they can to leverage for other services”. 
<br><br>
“Communities are using every means that they can to try and kind of leverage services from government at district, divisional and provincial level,” he added.
<br><br>
‘The government needs to look after us better’
<br><br>
When it comes to workers, in addition to the demanding conditions and hostility, they say low pay, salary delays, lack of assistance and compassion for those who are polio survivors themselves are some of the factors that they face.
<br><br>
Some health workers told Al Jazeera they get paid as little as 1,360 rupees per day (about $5) for at least eight hours of work. Catch-up days when they go out in the field after the end of the campaign to vaccinate children who were missed are not paid, they said.
<br><br>
Some polio survivors now working on the campaign do not receive help with transport or health benefits despite their conditions, leaving them to walk in poor weather and tough terrain to carry out their work.
“The amount I get paid is nowhere near enough, given how high the cost of living is now and the number of hours I put in,” a female health worker in the southern city of Karachi told Al Jazeera. She did not want her identity revealed for fear of losing her job.
<br><br>
“We have to run the house on credit, taking loans from friends and family,” she said. “We’re always in the red. I just think that, given the work we do, the government needs to look after us better, just like we’re doing for the children of the nation. I have a duty towards these children but I also need to think about my own kids.”
<br><br>
Just over 1,600km (994 miles) to the north at the Torkham border, one of the main crossing points between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the issues facing these workers remain the same.

<h2>Reaching the hard to reach</h2>

At the Torkham border, the main point of transit for travellers and goods between Pakistan and landlocked Afghanistan, a permanent vaccination point has been set while health workers are also present at security checkpoints leading to the border.
<br><br>
But a female worker administering vaccinations there lamented the lack of facilities for women at the location, including toilets and prayer rooms, “further exacerbating the challenges we already face while working in a male-dominated space”, she explained.
<br><br>
“Due to the continuous rush at the border, leave is not permitted. Salary delays and high inflation make it increasingly difficult to manage household expenses, particularly with school-going children and no additional sources of income,” the health worker, who did not wish to be named, told Al Jazeera.
<br><br>
In total, in the decade from 2013 to 2023, authorities managed to administer more than 300 million doses of oral vaccine each year with the help of more than 350,000 vaccinators. More than $9.3bn was spent by the polio eradication scheme on the efforts over that period. 
<br><br>
Despite this, Pakistan has so far been unable to eradicate polio.

After a meeting with American billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates in Islamabad in June, Pakistan’s PM Shehbaz Sharif said the government “remains steadfast” in its aim to eradicate polio.
<br><br>
Baig, the former NEOC chief, previously told Al Jazeera that the aim was to make Pakistan polio-free by 2026.
<br><br>
WHO’s Jafari says: “It is now a matter of getting to these final, hard-to-reach populations. When you start reaching these populations, progress happens very fast.”
